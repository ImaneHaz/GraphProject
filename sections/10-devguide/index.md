# Developer Guide

*GraphProject* is an open-source project, and we encourage contributions from developers who wish to participate in its development. To modify or add code to the current codebase, please follow these steps:

- Fork the project on GitHub.
- Add or modify the desired code, ensuring it aligns with the projectâ€™s structure and functionality.
- Add or modify tests that correspond to the changes made to ensure code reliability.
- Follow the semantics of **conventional commits** when writing commit messages.
- Submit a pull request documenting the changes made, explaining the choices and motivations behind them.

Once the pull request is submitted, the continuous integration (CI) process will automatically verify that the changes conform to the project's conventions and that the tests pass successfully. If everything is in order, the pull request will be accepted, resulting in the release of a new version of the software.
