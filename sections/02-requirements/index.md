# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
-**Tutor Recommendations**: Users should be able to input their age, preferred mode (remote or in-person), and location to receive personalized tutor recommendations.
    - Acceptance Criteria**: Recommendations should accurately match user preferences and display relevant tutor details like subject expertise, rating, and availability.
-**Graph Plotting**: Users should be able to input mathematical equations (e.g., y = x^2) and define X and Y ranges to generate graphs.
    - Acceptance Criteria**: Graphs should be plotted accurately and displayed within the specified range, with clear labels for axes.
-**User Authentication**: User Authentication (Future Enhancement):
Currently, the project allows users to directly access the graph plotting tool and search for tutors without requiring authentication. While user authentication is not implemented in the current version, it is something that can be developed in future iterations.
    - Acceptance Criteria**: No authentication is required for users to access the core functionality of the website 

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: The system must ensure that user data, including personal preferences and authentication details, are securely stored and transmitted.
    - Acceptance Criteria**: All sensitive data should be encrypted during transmission and at rest, with regular security audits confirming compliance.
-**Scalability**: The system should handle a large number of concurrent users and data requests without performance issues.
    - Acceptance Criteria**: Load tests should confirm stable performance under peak loads (e.g., 1,000 concurrent users or recommendations generated simultaneously).
-**Performance**: The system should return tutor recommendations and render graphs within an acceptable time frame.
    - Acceptance Criteria**: No authentication is required for users to access the core functionality of the website.

## Implementation Requirements
-**Responsive Web Interface**:
Implement a responsive web interface using modern web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to ensure that the site works smoothly across different browsers and device sizes.

-**Acceptance Criteria**:
The interface should adapt to various screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
CI/CD Pipeline:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes for the application.

-**Acceptance Criteria**:
All updates should pass automated tests before deployment, ensuring a seamless update process with minimal downtime.
